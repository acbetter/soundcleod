# SoundCleod OBS Edition (AC Better ver.)

This is another fork of [SoundCleod](https://soundcleod.com) originally created by [Márton Salomváry](https://github.com/salomvary). The only purpose of this fork is to integrate with [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/).

**This fork fixed issue [Audio not playing most of the time #2](https://github.com/ErraticFox/soundcleod/issues/2) of [ErraticFox's fork](https://github.com/ErraticFox/soundcleod).**

**If you have problems with the OBS integration, please contact [AC Better](https://github.com/acbetter), the creator and maintainer of this fork.**

If you do not use the OBS integration it is strongly recommended to use the latest [SoundCleod](https://soundcleod.com) from the original source.
